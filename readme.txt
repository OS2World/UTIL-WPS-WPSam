DESCRIPTION:

WPSam is a tool similar to WPSac. It allows to switch the desktop by switching to another OS2.INI file (and OS2SYS.INI). A fullscreen version is also contained (INITOS2)

WPSam is a program bundle, allowing to create and handle different desktops.

Every desktop is stored together with the corresponding INI files in a special folder, the so called user container (shortcut user).

To switch to another desktop simply double click the user container belonging to. It is also possible to enter the user name during boot of the computer.

There is a template for a user container contained in the templates folder. Please note that a new desktop is created for every user. This is the same action as is done during the first boot after installation of OS/2. Please be patient when a new user is opened first time.
